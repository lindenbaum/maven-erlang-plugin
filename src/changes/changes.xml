      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="2.2.0" date="2012-05-04" description="Feature and bugfix release">
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="add">
        Pre-compile sorting now supports the R15 `callback' attribute.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="fix" due-to="charpi">

        extracted.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="fix" issue="3502210" due-to="charpi">
        Made the application resource and upgrade files available during the
        test phase of application projects. This allows unit tests to call
        'application:start/1' or 'application:start/2' on the respective
        application under test.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="fix" issue="3502206" due-to="charpi">
        Removed `cover2.erl', now using normal coverage tool, solving issue
        with failing coverage reports when using the Meck mocking library.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="update">
        Enhanced the target system creation and execution by providing new start
        and attach scripts. Updated example documentation for target systems.

        resolution. Solves issues with missing erlang POM dependencies in
        release projects.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        Added automatic compilation of MIB files in either `src/main/mibs/' or
        `mibs/', for OTP and standard layout respectively. Compiled MIBs are put
        in the target `priv' directory.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Resources may now also use the `${NAME}' property for interpolation of
        the project name into resource files.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Updated resolution of required Erlang/OTP version, now also allowing an
        "or" concept using pipe "|" separated version, for example
        "R14B*|R15B*" - meaning any R14B or R15B version is valid.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="fix">
        Setting proper ownership of Temporary directory, for unpacked dependency
        priv resources, solving problems with un-readable packed priv files.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Profiling is no longer performed from normal EUnit tests, one must write
        test modules with the suffix `_prof.erl' profile code. NOTE: this change
        requires user action for projects that upgrade the plug-in. Also see use
        of the `-Dtest' parameter as an alternative solution.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        Added 'coverageExclude' to coverage reporting, allowing for optional
        exclusion of modules from the coverage report. Useful for generated or
        transformed source code, that may be hard or impossible to test.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="2.1.0" date="2011-09-23" description="Feature and bugfix release">
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        For test execution, the parameter 'test' now also supports a comma
        separated list of test modules to execute (-Dtest=foo,bar,baz) and not
        only a single value.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, lti" type="add">
        The plugin's backend nodes write their output to a logfile name
        'backend.log' located in the build directory. This is useful for
        debugging failed builds and unit test runs.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Changed resolution of required Erlang/OTP version to allow a trailing
        wildcard "*" - making it possible to require any maintenance release of
        some specified version, for example "R14B*".
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t, schlagert" type="fix">
        Changed method that adds uploaded resources to the path (patha), solves
        path issues when running a project on a remote node.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="fix">
        Copying of files will now preserve the executable bit. Uploaded
        resources will be flagged executable by default (on the remote machine).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, lti" type="fix">
        Avoid to unpack test scope dependencies when building a release project.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Resources will now be uploaded along with the modules and application
        files for the upload and run goals unless no temporary directory could
        be found on the target system. This fact will issue a warning message.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, lti" type="add">
        Implemented the goal 'erlang:run' for release projects.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Unique backend nodes will now be started per project in order to support
        parallel builds of different projects.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t, schlagert" type="add">
        Added validator mojo to check the project credentials for legal values.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update">
        Changed the working directory of the backend nodes to the project's
        build directory.

        Dialyzer mojo now checks for existing .erl-files before execution.
        Solves the problem with packaging projects not containing any source
        files (only includes).
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t, schlagert" type="add">
        Added 'compileFirst' and 'testCompileFirst' parameters for users to be
        able to define compile priority of project modules manually.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Changed binding for site generation, pre-site now invokes
        'erlang:coverage' and 'erlang:profile' in order to be able to build
        reports.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Changed coverage report, splitting it into an 'erlang:coverage' goal,
        that only produces coverage data TXT-file, and an
        'erlang:coverage-report' goal, that builds the HTML report.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="fix">
        Fixed problems when erlang runtime paths contain duplicate slashes
        (sometimes discovered on Linux and MacOS).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added support for the additional test source folder 'test' in erlang-std
        projects.

        Updated project configuration (POM) to work with Maven 3.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="fix">
        Enhanced compilation to check for exported "parse_transform/2" and sort
        those modules to the top of the compilation list. Resolves compilation
        dependencies issues.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, lti" type="fix">
        Backend nodes will now be started in fully qualified hostname mode
        (-name) using one of the IPv4 addresses configured on the host machine.
        This fixes problems with backend node connectivity in certain
        environments, e.g. problems experienced on MacOS X or in networks
        without running DNS services. In case reading the IP addresses from the
        network interfaces fails the old behaviour (-name bla@localhost) is
        used.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Provided an alternative for the ERL_FLAGS environment variable for
        target systems. This variable is useful when different releases (nodes)
        should be run on the same host.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update">
        Projects will now be run with dependencies by default when running an
        application in remote mode.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t, schlagert" type="fix">
        Fixed false test runner results when executing tests containing test
        generators.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update">
        Changed mojo logging to be more intuitive when displaying warnings and
        errors.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Modules defining custom behaviours will now be compiled. This avoids
        warnings emitted when behaviours can't be found.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        Added 'erlang:profile' and 'erlang:profiling-report' - eprof based
        profiling and reporting, using the tests in an application project.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added 'erlang:relup' to generate sensible release upgrade file
        templates based on installed/deployed versions of a project.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added 'erlang:appup' to generate sensible application upgrade file
        templates based on installed/deployed versions of a project.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="fix" issue="3240436">
        Fixed packaging problems where the wrong version string was used to
        for comparison when validating and checking dependencies.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="fix" issue="3240233">
        Fixed packaging problems of release projects when the backend node has
        several OTP installations in its library directory. Standard OTP
        application dependencies will now be searched for in the code path of
        the current backend node.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="2.0.0" date="2011-03-18" description="First stable release">
      <action dev="ghaskins" type="add" issue="3167277">
        Added tool 'eapp2mvn' to deploy non-maven packaged erlang applications
        to a maven repository using configurable coordinates.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="add">
        Added generated help mojo 'erlang:help' to display information about the
        available goals.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, heyll" type="remove">
        Removed the 'failIfNoTests' parameter for simplifying plug-ing usage.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="fix">
        Fixed dangling application project dependencies in 'target/lib' when
        changing a dependency version and not 'cleaning' the next build.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="update">
        Made 'relup' and 'sys.config' files mandatory in erlang-rel projects.
        Added basic template generation for those in 'erlang:setup'.
      </action>
      <action dev="heyll" type="add">
        Added the 'erlang:show-build-info' goal that outputs code paths and
        include paths used to compile the erlang sources, so that other tools
        (i.e. emacs) can compile erlang files of a mavenized erlang project.
      </action>
      <action dev="ghaskins" type="add">
        Added UnArchiver support to erlang-rel artifacts. This allows other
        projects to consume these artifacts, e.g. rpm-maven-plugin based
        artifacts.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="remove">
        Removed built-in mock library support. Use external library instead.
        E.g. 'erlymock' by Sven Heyll (https://github.com/sheyll/erlymock).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added experimental goal to create a startable target system from a
        release project (according to the official erlang documentation).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="update">
        Changed semantics of the ${ERTS} release packaging variables to expand
        to the complete erts version tuple as required by the release file's
        erts section.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">

      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update">
        Changed semantics of the ${APPLICATION_NAME} release packaging
        variables to expand to the complete application name, version tuple as

      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update" issue="3166835">
        Changed semantics of ${APPLICATIONS} for erlang-otp/erlang-std projects.
        This will now expand to a comma separated listing instead of an erlang
        list.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="update" >
        Release and release upgrade files of erlang-rel projects must now be of
        the form [ARTIFACTID].rel / [ARTIFACTID].relup. This allows usage of the
        maven-release-plugin that changes the effective project version in the
        pom while building. Though, generated release artifacts will retain the
        version information in the filenames.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="fix" issue="3166359" due-to="ghaskins">
        Added support to recognise both British and American spelling of the
        -behaviour tag.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="update" issue="3166835" due-to="ghaskins">
        Refined dependency management of releases by choosing the standard
        Erlang/OTP application versions from a specific OTP release.
        Availability of the required release is checked (but may be skipped for
        testing purposes).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="update" issue="3166182" due-to="ghaskins">
        Improved application packaging by adding the customizable ${APPLICATIONS}
        packaging variable which expands to all application dependencies (except

        standard ones).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="update">
        Introduced two backend nodes. One used for testing and another one for
        compiling, packaging, running projects.
      </action>
      <action dev="olle-t" type="add">
        Added plain text coverage report as optional output direct to stdout
        instead of saved coverage report.

      <action dev="schlagert" type="remove">
        Removed support for SNMP resource compilation.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="remove">
        Main and test resources no longer supported by packaging, replaced with

      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added support for test and provided scope dependencies.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Fixed run goal erlang:run to start all transitive application
        dependencies and pre-load all project (and dependency) modules. The goal
        can now run projects on remote nodes (located on another machine).
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added more checks for release file management support, removed automatic
        release file generation.

      <action dev="schlagert, olle-t" type="add">
        All mojos now use jinterface for erlang rpcs instead of using
        erl -run or erl -eval. First of all this speeds up the build
        significantly. Another big advantage is that the plugin can now be
        integrated into the development using emacs with the distel extension
        since the plugin can use the emacs distel node or vice versa.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added packaging type erlang-std which respects the default Erlang/OTP
        application directory layout.
      </action>
      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Test suffixes can now be either "_test" (for backward compatibility) or

    <release version="1.0.0-beta" date="2010-12-17" description="Initial release">
      <action dev="olle-t" type="update">
        Changed the use of the "test" property, a single specified test

      <action dev="schlagert" type="add">
        Added run goal for packaging erlang-otp to compile/test and run an
