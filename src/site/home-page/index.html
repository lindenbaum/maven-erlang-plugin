        <h1>The Maven Erlang Plug-In</h1>
			</header>
			<p>This plug-in for Maven <strong>makes it very easy to build, test, 
			package and deploy Erlang applications</strong> and projects. It
			<strong>manages dependencies and artifacts</strong> and allows for 
			trouble-free <strong>integration with existing software development 
			infrastructure</strong>.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Release packaging - this plug-in does it!</strong> Combine
			library- and OTP-applications into release systems and upgrade packages 
			that can be used directly with the Erlang release handling tools. 
			Deployment and system upgrade can't be easier.</p>
